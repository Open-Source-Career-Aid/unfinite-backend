(2) leveraging this model, the joint program of flight mission planning and recharging optimization is formulated as a multi-criteria asymmetric traveling salesman problem (atsp), wherein a drone seeks for the time-optimal energy-feasible tour that visits all the target sites and refuels whenever necessary. (3) we devise an efficient approximation algorithm with provable worst-case performance guarantees and implement it in a drone management system, which supports real-time flight path tracking and re-computation in dynamic environments. (4) the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed approach are validated through extensive numerical simulations as well as real-world experiments.",10.1109/tase.2022.3175565,2017-03-29,2022-04-19,"['rashid alyassi', 'majid khonji', 'areg karapetyan', 'sid chi-kin chau', 'khaled elbassioni', 'chien-ming tseng']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.10049.pdf

(2021) observed two important phenomena. the first, dubbed progressive sharpening, is that the sharpness steadily increases throughout training until it reaches the instability cutoff $2/\eta$. the second, dubbed edge of stability, is that the sharpness hovers at $2/\eta$ for the remainder of training while the loss continues decreasing, albeit non-monotonically. we demonstrate that, far from being chaotic, the dynamics of gradient descent at the edge of stability can be captured by a cubic taylor expansion: as the iterates diverge in direction of the top eigenvector of the hessian due to instability, the cubic term in the local taylor expansion of the loss function causes the curvature to decrease until stability is restored. this property, which we call self-stabilization, is a general property of gradient descent and explains its behavior at the edge of stability. a key consequence of self-stabilization is that gradient descent at the edge of stability implicitly follows projected gradient descent (pgd) under the constraint $s(\theta) \le 2/\eta$. our analysis provides precise predictions for the loss, sharpness, and deviation from the pgd trajectory throughout training, which we verify both empirically in a number of standard settings and theoretically under mild conditions. our analysis uncovers the mechanism for gradient descent's implicit bias towards stability.",,2022-09-30,2023-04-10,"['alex damian', 'eshaan nichani', 'jason d. lee']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.15594.pdf
